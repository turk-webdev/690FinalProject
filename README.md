# 690FinalProject

*Note:* There is an inconcistency with the table view. When opening up the report, sometimes there is an error that an Affine Transform could not be done due to a singular matrix. I am not quite sure how to fix this and have sort of run out of time to debug it, as at this moment I need to move on to other finals. The table does **sometimes** work, it might require a few relaunches of the app.

Had I more time, I would fix this issue by implementing a sort of "Dequeue" process for when the "back" button is pressed, and would look a bit more into how to "reload data" for the cocoa pod data charts.
